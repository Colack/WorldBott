# WorldBott
[WorldBott](https://github.com/Colack/WorldBott/) is a proof-of-concept bot that I made for [[WUT] World](https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/307ZOMkSuj8A6nSgGn_3E-tJTUcm4lhwFg-6rhIbVzs).    
It uses Python to control the Mouse and post messages to the app.

Your computer needs to have something like Visual Studio code open first, and google chrome or whatever browser you are using in the background.   
You will also need to have your computers scale changed to 125%.
